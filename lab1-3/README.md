Referring to your \'Counters\' class, this form of encapsulation is not very scalable. Perhaps you might want to create a \'Shop\' class which HAS-A \'Counter\' class. You might realise in Lab2 that having a \'Customer\' class might be extremely helpful too.

- Your ShopEventDirectDeparture class doesn\\'t seem very necessary.
- I understand what you are trying to do with your ShopEvent class, but I think it is unnecessary abstraction in this case. Your subclasses can just extend from Event class directly.
- Really good use of Optional in your Shop class, but imports are not allowed unless specified. (I did not deduct this time but please be mindful in subsequent labs)
